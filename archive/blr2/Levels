======================WARNING, LOTS OF WORDS BELOW!======================
Level 1			2/180
River levels			120
-It's confusing... so much bullets for Level1?
 However it's fairly easy. Do not seek for death(where those "+1" are
 leading you to)

Double-directed labyrinth	60
-Still very easy.

Level 2			4/215
Polygon-red			60
-This is not hard...
 Fake bullets aren't always annoying.

Polygon-white			60
-Make good use of precise mode.

Polygon-white locked		6
-You can't move vertically!
 Find a good position, e.g. near by a line.

Polygon-both			30
-This part doesn't make sense.

Level 3			4/150
Reflective			30
-Just meet them, do not make big movements.
 They are pretty friendly aren't they?

*4				30
-It's a little difficult... Keep away from the edges!

Rotate ????			60
-Stay away from the rotating bullets.

Wall of blues?			30
-Rather easy. Do not try to earn too may semi-collisions unless
 you are really skilled.
 Looks awesome?

Level 4			5/243
Orange				30
-Don't make big movements and stay away from the edges. (why?)
 Those fast bullets are really annoying.

Orange trap			5+5+4+4+3+3+2+2+5
-Do NOT press shift!

Double spinner			60
-An easy part for level 4.

Squash-2			60
-Enjoy it yourself.
 I think it may make the situation worse.

Circle-drawing			60
-Just draw the circle.
 If you have any problem, try BLR 1.

Level 5			8/338
CChase				30+30
-Don't set player move speed to 1!
 Remark: They are not really faster than you...

Vortex of leaves		60
-This is another annoying level, looks awesome and hard.
 Keep away from those 'laser''s!
 Remark: The lasers may have strange collision detection...
 Be careful!

Upstream flow			60
-Rather easy.
 Looks like something in level 3.

High speed threaten		30
-It's JUST threaten!
 Precision is important.
 Practice makes perfect.
 If you *can't* move horizonally may be it's easier...

Crossing threaten		30
-Appears very hard.
 Choose the correct time to cross those bullets.

Orange trap2			2+2+2+5
-Just another level from level 4.

Fish in the barrel		60
-Seems to be faster and faster? NO...
 Remark: Those bullets are comming directly towards you.

the Unbreakable jail		30
-This is fairly hard. Use CLR if you need it.
 Remark: When the 'target' got red, it's about to update its
 position. If you keep moving when it's updating its position,
 it will stuck in update mode, or it will stop.

Level 6			7/390
Snow WHITE			30
-Incredible fast. Do not treat your CLR as a
 Â£100,000,000 cheque.
 Remark: They are accelerated!

Photokeratitis			10+10+10+10+10
-This used to be sickly hard...
 Treat fast bullets and slow bullets separately.
 Remark: It looks like Wriggle Nightbug's spellcard...
 As of r94, it's not so hard as it was before. Fast bullets
 won't hit you *if you don't move*.

Squash-4(?)			60
-Do not be trapped! You only need ONE CLR!...

Avalanche			60
-Do not stay at the screen bottom, it's very dangerous...

Dangerous target		60
-Keep moving!
 It's a nightmare if you've choose a slow player...
 Remark: The target follows you as a yellow bullet does,
 but not in the same manner.

Hexagon loops			10+20+7+7+7+19
-Step well back and watch the show.
 Remark: This level will misbehave if FPS dropped...

Hyperfluid			60
-Also known as Superfluid.
 In fact, liquid helium is not cold enough. It's still several
 Kelvin's degrees. I can make it even colder.
 Remark: The white bullets are not accelerated, which are different
 from the blue ones. The blue bullets share the same direction: 45 deg.
 Also will become easier if horizonal movement is restricted...

Level 7			12/930+			Mapped levels
Spring thunder storm - panic?		60	Thunder storm...
-Although it's based on something from level 6, they are completely
 different!
 And this one is really easy.
 Remark: Try to get to the top of the screen...
 Try restricting vertical movement this time...

Rainbow tower - color theory		90	rainbow tower
-Basic level.
 Remark: It's taken from the old testbed version of BLRII.

Rainbow bullets - nauty photon		60	Lazy level;)
-Similar to one part in level1, but *much* harder.
 Luck is really required.
 Remark: The generation of bullets is really strange... If the last position
 on the y axis is taken up... sorry that I started to talk about coding again.

Rainbow effect - appearance		60	draw a rainbow (of bullet)
-Random bullets. You will remember this part at once when you see the part.
 If you feel it hard, go to assessment mode.
 Remark: The bullets forming the rainbow are invincible.

Rainbow effect - interference		120	as the name tells
-This part is REALLY easy... but why?

Rainbow effect - diffraction		120	as the name tells
-Pretty hard. Those piles of shit may crash straight into you.
 The code is pretty ugly too.

Rainbow effect - photon school		60	"particalization"!
-Pretty hard. Use CLR if necessary.
 It may be easier if you stay near the edges. (I don't really know.)

Over the Rainbow - infinity challenge	-	great circles
-Your goal is to reach the red block...
 And, this one is also pretty hard...
 If you're not well-skilled and you are working on FPM, try --suicide--,
 it worthwhile to do so!
 Remark: This level will never end if you don't reach the red block...

Trypophobia				120	another two classes: Tail & Pile
-Very hard. You'll never know where they will go next(neither will they).
 However, they won't step on the same place twice.
 Will this cause trypophobia?
 Remark: This level almost burn my computer...
 I seem to forget an important thing: Bullets with effects won't collide
 for a short time after they are created...

Photon fission				90	Use a slightly modified tower8...
-Directed bullets+random bullets.
 Find a formula for it.

Wave of Photon				60	class WOP+Lazy of particalization
-Not very hard at the beginning...

Return to void				90	return (void)(...);
-VERY HARD!!!
 I don't know where this came from.
 CLR is useless but it will give you a short period during which you are invincible.
 Remark: There are "no solution" cases...

Level -1(Extreme)	7/1020
unknown circles1		60
-They slow down as they approach the border. VERY ANNOYING!!!

unknown circles2		60
-They STUCK at the border!! And they get THICKER and THICKER!!......

Spiky					120
-Hard. Their behavior is not predictable.
 Remark: Again, never try to approach lasers! They are harmful to your eyes...

Achromatopsia				120(90+30)
-There's no way?!
 Well, mind the name please...
 Or we should call this "deuteranopia vs protanopia"?
 Remark: Color change may suddenly happen!!

Quad thread				120
-Do you humans really support it?
 Remark: I don't...

Gravity vortex				120
-It has nothing to do with gravity at all, but it's pretty
 hard!
 Seems to be very graceful.

Supernova(additive blending)		120
-After gathering enough power, they explode --
 Awesome supernova!
 I enjoy coding(such easy parts)...
 Remark: Newly created bullets are... I can't give more clue.

yellow explosive			90
-There's nothing to code, so I came up with this...
 --Not deadly at all.--

Sink over the horizon			90
-Strange. You will be easily trapped.

Incomplete Reflective			120
-Start in peace, end in mess.
 Remark: one in four bullets will explode when it hits the wall.

Level -2(Assess)	10/?

You will certainly die. So let me predict your cause of death...

Directed bullet
-This is actually a copy of...
 Towers don't collide you, however they should do so.
 You may end up in... whatever you want.

Random bullet
-Pure random.
 Are they getting faster?
 You may end up in a huge mess.

Constant patterns
-Pretty awesome.
 Doesn't look like anything.
 You may end up in a horror.

Crossing 1(L+R)
-They started spinning!!!
 You may end up like a juicy orange in a squeezer.

Crossing 2(C)
-Used by Moriya Suwako...
 Round bullets made me dizzy.
 You may end up like...
 That scene is really terrible!

Trappy
-The name is strange...
 Remark: The lasers created just over you are not created there on purpose...
 However, one third of the bullets could be directed.
 You may end up without your awareness.

Sine wave
-Oscilloscope?
 Find a good place to vibrate with the graph...
 Remark: Some positions will cause death instantly!
 You may end up...
 Oops! I can't find you on that broken oscilloscope!

Density test
-Really high density.
 WTF? There's no way?!
 You MUST end up in a horrible traffic accident, squeezing every drop of blood
 out on the left board. That's really a bad image.

"Pinballs"
-Well... They have collisions since r93!
 These balls spawn with random velocity!
 You may end up...
 just imagine an eXtra-eXtra Large sized bowling ball flying direct towards you.

Road Blocks
-You'll understand this one day.
 --Flappy square?...
 You death cause could be the same as the one in "Density test".
 Don't ask why. I feel sick now...

Extreme High speed
-Copy of one part in level 5.
 You may end up in just *two* seconds.

Laser crosses
-Only a show off of the Laser class.
 You might end up like... Coal Dust? (Sorry I'm playing Industrial Craft2 these
 days)

Bonus test: Lunatic Lunar!
-May be the legacy of a vintage game...
 You may end up... sorry, this in not predictable..
