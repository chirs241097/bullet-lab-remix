## About the releases
BLR 1 - The Creature of Colour was completed in early 2014.
BLR 2 - The Reunion of Rainbow was completed in late 2014.
BLR 3 - Mind in Circuits was started in June 2015 and is now in active development.
BLR 3.5 - Assessment Collection has been planned.

Only the mainline will stay in the root directory of the repo,
older releases will go to the archive folder (I don't think
git branching is suitable for the case).
