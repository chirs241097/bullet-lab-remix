0.7.2-1_PR (b71)
(Level7 will be almost twice longer than Level6!)
I'm extremely tired these days, I can't even keep my eyes open
while typing...
Some of my classmates helped testing several levels and found
some bugs, thanks a lot!

After a short test, I found that the Windows build is almost
broken... Crashes and misbehaves are everywhere!

Maybe Windows is noble and won't run this garbage:(
===Real changelog starts from here===
New level "Trypophobia", however it seems that this level won't
cause trypophobia at all!
New level "Photon fusion", using a slightly modified Tower8.
Rewrote laser distance detection using vector2d calculations,
extending libcgh and bump its version at the same time.(*2)
Put the new level to the correct place.
Bring back "Minesweeper" level, adjust it to the new interfaces.
Convert Bullet from struct to class.
Bring back Classic Mode. There are no "easy", "normal" or "hard"
now, there's only "classic"! Fix problems with the classic mode in
the new code base.
Fixed a bug appeared after the levels were put together.
Other minor changes to the level WOP.
Minor cleanups and code style adjustments. Add missing free's and
delete's.
Remake the credits page, it grows from 350KiB to 6MiB. (And so I'll
enable PNG compression later.)

0.7.2-0_PR (b70)
I wasn't willing to bump the build number because I want the svn
revision to chase the build number.
However it wouldn't be appropriate to put three new levels into one
build...
The real changelog is here:
New level "interference" (it's another small class "SimpleThing").
New level "diffraction" (yet another dull class), hopefully fixed a
memory leak in this level (by using more memory!)
Rearrange levels to the order they will appear in the final version.
New background interface, use background pictures easily.
Make "Tiled" background mode work.
Add SetScale to background class. Make you dizzy easily...
Fix a small glitch in Level3Part3-4. This level won't run correctly
under Low FPS Mode.
Minor code cleanups.
Removed more useless comments, my code is still hard to comprehend,
though.
Fix the misbehave of modulo with minus numbers...
Small interface and behaviour changes:
-If a bullet is effect-attatched and the effect is running, it won't
die.
-Bullet::redir now always make dist=1, for some bullet processing
doesn't use dist now.
Don't copyleft, it's radical.

0.7.1-6_PR (b69)
Finish some new levels ("Great Circle" bring back & "rainbow
appearance").
Fusion bullet first work draft.
Fix some of the warnings from the compiler.
Adjust level difficulty. It was indeed too easy...

Small code cleanups.

Bullet death effect, applied to Wave of Photon. It seems buggy.
Fixed something left for debuging in the last commit.

0.7.1-1_PR (b64)
New level: Wave of Photon. A lazy level again. Despite of a new
class, it's a copy of "photon school".
Level improved: Cross threaten. Make it impossible to pass this
part without crossing those blue bullets.
libcgh improvement. Added new interfaces to vector2d struct. So the
libcgh version was bumped. Was it worth doing that?

0.7.1-0_PR (b63)
New level: Rainbow bullets - nauty photon (in fact it's a lazy
level! I must have seen the same thing some where else...)
The last "photon school" level was put to where it should be.
Rewrite some silly parts of the Changelog.
I ran out of my AppEngine quota today... So I can't commit that to
svn as planned...

0.7.0-9_PR (b62)
Performed a couple of tests, under both full FPS mode and low FPS
mode.
New background is used by now.

0.7.0-8_PR (b61)

Spotlight: Supporting BGM loop points(using my new hge
interfaces...)!
I have no idea on new levels (except "hyper fluid", that's a well-
planned part...). Maybe I've spent too much time staring at the
desktop? I feel like void these days.
The build count is bumped four times a day, you enough!

0.6.1-2_PR (b47)
New level "Wriggle Nightbug-like"?...
