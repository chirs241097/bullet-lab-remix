Bullet death effect, applied to Wave of Photon. It seems buggy.
Fixed something left for debuging in the last commit.

0.7.1-1_PR (b64)
New level: Wave of Photon. A lazy level again. Despite of a new
class, it's a copy of "photon school".
Level improved: Cross threaten. Make it impossible to pass this
part without crossing those blue bullets.
libcgh improvement. Added new interfaces to vector2d struct. So the
libcgh version was bumped. Was it worth doing that?

0.7.1-0_PR (b63)
New level: Rainbow bullets - nauty photon (in fact it's a lazy
level! I must have seen the same thing some where else...)
The last "photon school" level was put to where it should be.
Rewrite some silly parts of the Changelog.

svn as planned...

planned part...). Maybe I've spent too much time staring at the
