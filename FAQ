===Under Construction===
In fact, these Q&A's are not asked frequently at all.
They all came from the messed up mind of the author!

Q: I JUST CAN'T start it! (I can't see even a window!)
A: Something must went wrong. There are two general causes.
   1. Failed to load a shared library.
   2. Initialization Failure.
If the first one happened, BLRLOG.TXT will not even be created.
To solve it, install the required runtime libs.
If the second one happened, you can find out what really happened in
BLRLOG.txt.

However, the first one is not likely to happen. The official Windows
build doesn't have too much external dependencies.

Q: It crashed!
A: This program is *pretty unstable* and may crash at any time.
   If it crashed, you can post your problem with BLRLOG.txt attatched
   to google code issue tracker. I'll try to fix the problem if I can
   reproduce it.

Q: "Cannot decompress resources!" (Windows only)
A: I've compressed the resources of the game for Windows. As the game
   starts, it will create two folders and decompress the resources
   into them. If that failed, this problem will be reported.
   Restarting the game may solve the problem.

Q: Your code cannot compile!
A: I'm pretty sure that it CAN compile(on my machine).
   Check if you have all required sdks.
   Additionally, if you checked out an older revision from svn, I
   cannot guarantee that it can compile!

Q: You included in-game music in your package, but they are not played!
A: The playing code is commented. You can figure it out yourself.

Q: What are BLRData.dtp and BLRMusic.dtp?
A: As the name tells, these are archives containing the game data.
   You can decompress them with expand.exe (which may be found in
   the mystery folder "system32").

Q: It's blurred?
A: The game was designed for 800x600, and if you are using a resolution
   other than 800x600 or running in fullscreen, this problem may occur.

Q: I don't think the graphics are being rendered correctly.
A: I don't know much about DirectX, for I left hge DirectX untouched.
   However it shouldn't differ too much from the OpenGL version.
   All quads are rendered as triangles, and uses vertex buffer.
   Maybe there are "graphics driver dependent" contents, I'll correct them
   later.

Q: Tell me the history.
A: Changelog tracked a full history of this project (Although it's not
   detailed).
   By the way, this project started as a fork of BLR I, which is already
   closed by me now.

Q: Are there command line options?
A: Yes. It's documented in README.txt.
   BTW, --start and --fast came up for debug purpose only.
   However they are a hidden bonus for cheaters.
   So, I won't remove that in the final version. I promise.
   (P.S.: misusage of --start may cause severe problems!)

Q: Rankings of this game?
A: If you can reach level 1~3...
   --You are not suitable playing this sort of game.
   If you can reach level 4~6...
   --You are a normal human-being.
   If you can pass level 6 or reach level 7...
   --You are unusual.
   If you can pass level 7...
   --Are you "nobody"?
   If you can pass level -1...
   --Tell me the reason why you come to Earth...

Q: Are there other awards?
A: Sorry, no... 
   You won't get anything but the ranking even you've passed level -1 without
   collisions.
   So... enjoy it yourself.
 
Q: What hardwares/softwares do you use?
A: I'm using a Lenovo Ideapad Y570 with Intel Core i7-2670QM CPU.
   It has 8GiB of RAM and HD3000+Nvidia GT 555M. However I've disabled
   GT 555M in BIOS so that it won't heat too much. Additionally,
   I've got a 256GiB Crucial M4 SSD (That's useless, uh?).
   This game is mainly developed under GNU/Linux.
   I use Debian sid as my main system. (Yes, that's one of the reasons why
   I like to "live on the edge".) KDE is my current desktop environent.
   Usually, I use Code::Blocks IDE. Sometimes I use vim/geany+gdb.
   For windows version compile, I use Visual Studio 2013 express.
   The game graphic resources are made with GIMP.
   Musics are made with Rosegarden, synthed with fluidsynth(qsynth frontend),
   recorded with jack.record.
